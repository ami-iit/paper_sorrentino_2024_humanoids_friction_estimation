\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a scalable method for friction identification in robots equipped with electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives, utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). This approach eliminates the need for dedicated setups and joint torque sensors by leveraging the robotâ€™s intrinsic model and state data. We present a comprehensive pipeline that includes data acquisition, preprocessing, ground truth generation, and model identification. The effectiveness of the PINN-based friction identification is validated through extensive testing on two different joints of the humanoid robot ergoCub, comparing its performance against traditional static friction models like the Coulomb-viscous and Stribeck-Coulomb-viscous models. Integrating the identified PINN-based friction models into a two-layer torque control architecture enhances real-time friction compensation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in control performance and reductions in energy losses, highlighting the scalability and robustness of the proposed method, also for application across a large number of joints as in the case of humanoid robots.
% This paper introduces a scalable method for friction identification using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). Our approach, designed specifically for robots equipped with electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives, removes the need for dedicated setups and joint torque sensors by leveraging the robot's model and state information. We present a comprehensive pipeline for friction identification encompassing data acquisition, processing, ground truth generation, and model identification. The effectiveness of the PINN model is validated against classical static friction models, including Coulomb-viscous and Stribeck-Coulomb-viscous models, through extensive testing on the ankle joint of the humanoid robot ergoCub. The identified friction models are integrated into a two-layer torque control architecture to enhance real-time friction compensation. Our results demonstrate that the PINN model improves control performance and reduces energy losses.
